Unit testing from spring helps to test individual part of project(web->controller , data- > repository , business -> service classes)
we can mock other dependent part eg service layer depending on data layer then we can mock data layer in unit test of service layer

We could mock using stub for above case but that is not maintainable as for each methoid differnet scenraios will be there and we need to create that many stubvs
also so many method mesans stubs will be big and certainly not maintainable
Also if in future a new method comes in interface we will ave to add that method in 100s of stubs created already

Better approach is to use stub

The name of a class runnig for maven test should always end with Test/Tests otherwiese Maven skips the class
