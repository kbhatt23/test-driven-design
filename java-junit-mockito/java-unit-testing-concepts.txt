Unit testing goal is to test a unit of code (method/class)
-> indepdent of other units just test one unit / set of units

Junit can be used to automate the unit/integration testing and helps in saving time/effort of manual testing

Even an empty test method succeeds in testing
as only when failure happens or Assert fail is manually invoked or an assertion fails then the red bar comes in junit report

@test works only with public void signature only other signature it throws exception
maven picks classes ending with Test string only and other clases are skipped

@before gets called before every @test method
@after gets called after every @test method
so before and after can be used to initalize the data and clean up the data before and after each test
- eg is some sample data jpa test where each time before we setup some tables in repository
  and after each method calls we remove that data so that before anothher test the data is stored back again
 this helps in consistency as in any test data might be modified and this could cause issue in assertions

@afterclass and @before class are called once per class 
meaning @beforeclass will be called before @before and any other test case
@after gets called after @after and any other test case

In case any test case method is expected to throw exception we can put @Test(expected =Excelption.class)
To test performace we can set time out if test of that method takes more that this it fails that specific unit test case
eg @Test(timeout=100) -> 100 mili second

Junit suite is needed to group tests togerther
lets say there are 2 suites one normal and one for perfromace testing
so awe do not want to test performace classes always
so we create two suites one having business tests and other having performaces test and we can run only one suite

We can manage the suite using maven sure fire plugin using includes configuration

Stubs can be used for mocking but it has disavantages:
a. dynamic condition need to be added as if else -> like need to test sceanrio which return emppty list, list of string having string chars ert. 
	-> so we need to create os many stubs for each scenario or need to add if else condition
b. inheritance contract: if a new method comes in super we need to overidde this for all the stubs at som many places

if when condition of mock bean is not met it returns default/happy values
a. for object/clases -> null
b. arrays -> arrays object with 0 size
c. list/collection -> collection with 0 size
d. boolean -> false
e. integer -> 0

BDD means behavior driven design
This is process of managing system unit to create various scenarios that end user will face
it breaks thing into given(current data setup) , when(input method), then(assertion) part


@mock creates mock bean for dependency class and also inject to the class annotated with @injectMocks . Also the main class also get created and no need to call consustructor in code

@captor annotaion can be used to create ArgumentCaptor instance and hence helping in writing less code

@rule is enahncement to @runner as we cna have only one runner but can have multiple @rule to manage things in junit

Spy is same as mock in all cases excepot cases when .mock method is not defined instead of happ/deault returns it actually calls rela methoid for mock class
eg:
mockList.add(23) ; syso(mockList.size()) will print 0
but in case spyList.add(23) ; syso(spyList.size()) will print 1
